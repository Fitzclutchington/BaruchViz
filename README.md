Baruch Spreadsheet Conversion Scripts
=====================================

These scripts were designed to convert spreadsheets provided by the data center at Baruch 
College to a csv file that can be displayed using iDashboard visualization software. This
conversion is necesarry because iDashboard provide little functionality to perform
aggregation of datasheets.
